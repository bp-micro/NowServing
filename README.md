# NowServing

NowServing is a simple counter application for an arduino pro micro.

You press button, the 3-digit seven-segment LED display increments the number. It'll count from zero up to 999.

If you press and hold the button for four seconds, it will restart at zero.

This was written in VS Code using the PlatformIO plugin. Yes, it's super rough, but I have a lot of projects to get done.
